Accessed on September 12, 2019.", "ref_pds": 0.35419999999999996, "most_similar": "The term “recurrent neural network” is used indiscriminately to  refer to two broad classes of networks with a similar general structure,  where one is finite impulse and the other is infinite impulse. Both classes of networks exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.[7] A finite impulse recurrent network is a directed acyclic graph that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network, while an infinite impulse recurrent network is a directed cyclic graph that can not be unrolled.\nA recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs.[1][2][3] This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition[4] or speech recognition.[5][6]\nThey are in fact recursive neural networks  with a particular structure: that of a linear chain. Whereas recursive  neural networks operate on any hierarchical structure, combining child  representations into parent representations, recurrent neural networks  operate on the linear progression of time, combining the previous time  step and a hidden representation into the representation for the current  time step.\nBoth finite impulse and infinite impulse recurrent networks can  have additional stored states, and the storage can be under direct  control by the neural network. The storage can also be replaced by  another network or graph, if that incorporates time delays or has  feedback loops. Such controlled states are referred to as gated state or  gated memory, and are part of long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units. This is also called Feedback Neural Network (FNN).\nA recursive neural network[32] is created by applying the same set of weights recursively over a differentiable graph-like structure by traversing the structure in topological order. Such networks are typically also trained by the reverse mode of automatic differentiation.[33][34] They can process distributed representations of structure, such as logical terms.  A special case of recursive neural networks is the RNN whose structure  corresponds to a linear chain. Recursive neural networks have been  applied to natural language processing.[35] The Recursive Neural Tensor Network uses a tensor-based composition function for all nodes in the tree.[36]\n^ Graves,  Alex; Fernández, Santiago; Gomez, Faustino J.

The fundamental unit of a neural network is a node,  which is loosely based on the biological neuron in the mammalian brain.  The connections between neurons are also modeled on biological brains,  as is the way these connections develop over time (with “training”).\nAdapting  the learning rate for your stochastic gradient descent optimization  procedure can increase performance and reduce training time. Sometimes  this is called learning rate annealing or adaptive learning rates.  The simplest and perhaps most used adaptation of learning rate during  training are techniques that reduce the learning rate over time. These  have the benefit of making large changes at the beginning of the  training procedure when larger learning rate values are used, and  decreasing the learning rate such that a smaller rate and therefore  smaller training updates are made to weights later in the training  procedure. This has the effect of quickly learning good weights early  and fine tuning them later.\n learning then can be defined as neural networks with a large number of \nthe context words to a neural network and predict the word in the center\nIn this post, I am mainly interested in the latter 3 architectures.
