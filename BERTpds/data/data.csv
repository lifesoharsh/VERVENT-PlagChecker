The received data in the data acquisition layer is then sent forward  to the data processing layer where it is subjected to advanced  integration and processing and involves normalization of the data, data  cleaning, transformation, and encoding. The data processing  is also dependent on the type of learning being used. For e.g., if  supervised learning is being used the data shall be needed to be  segregated into multiple steps of sample data required for training of  the system and the data thus created is called training sample data or  simply training data. Also, the data processing is dependent upon the  kind of processing required and may involve choices ranging from action  upon continuous data which will involve the use of specific  function-based architecture, for example, lambda architecture, Also it  might involve action upon discrete data which may require memory-bound  processing. The data processing layer defines if the memory processing  shall be done to data in transit or in rest.

In supervised learning,  the training data used for is a mathematical model that consists of  both inputs and desired outputs. Each corresponding input has an  assigned output which is also known as a supervisory signal. Through the  available training matrix, the system is able to determine the  relationship between the input and output and employ the same in  subsequent inputs post-training to determine the corresponding output.  The supervised learning can further be broadened into classification and  regression analysis  based on the output criteria. Classification analysis is presented when  the outputs are restricted in nature and limited to a set of values.  However, regression analysis defines a numerical range of values for the  output. Examples of supervised learning are seen in face detection,  speaker verification systems.

Accessed on September 12, 2019.",0.49440000000000006,"When trained on a set of examples without supervision, a DBN can learn to probabilistically reconstruct its inputs. The layers then act as feature detectors.[1] After this learning step, a DBN can be further trained with supervision to perform classification.[2]
DBNs can be viewed as a composition of simple, unsupervised networks such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)[1] or autoencoders,[3] where each sub-network's hidden layer serves as the visible layer for the next. An RBM is an undirected,  generative energy-based model with a ""visible"" input layer and a hidden  layer and connections between but not within layers. This composition  leads to a fast, layer-by-layer unsupervised training procedure, where contrastive divergence is applied to each sub-network in turn, starting from the ""lowest"" pair of layers (the lowest visible layer is a training set).
Initialize the visible units to a training vector.
^ Bengio Y, Lamblin P, Popovici D, Larochelle H (2007). Greedy Layer-Wise Training of Deep Networks (PDF). NIPS.
The observation[2] that DBNs can be trained greedily, one layer at a time, led to one of the first effective deep learning algorithms.[4]:6 Overall, there are many attractive implementations and uses of DBNs in real-life applications and scenarios (e.g., electroencephalography,[5] drug discovery[6][7][8]).
Once an RBM is trained, another RBM is ""stacked"" atop it, taking its  input from the final trained layer. The new visible layer is initialized  to a training vector, and values for the units in the already-trained  layers are assigned using the current weights and biases. The new RBM is  then trained with the procedure above. This whole process is repeated  until the desired stopping criterion is met.[12]
""Deep Belief Networks"". Deep Learning Tutorials.
In machine learning, a deep belief network (DBN) is a generative graphical model, or alternatively a class of deep neural network, composed of multiple layers of latent variables (""hidden units""), with connections between the layers but not between units within each layer.[1]

We train the discriminator just like a deep network classifier. If the input is real, we want D(x)=1. If  it is generated, it should be zero. Through this process, the  discriminator identifies features that contribute to real images.
Generator and discriminator
the generator creates images that the discriminator cannot tell the

However,  we encounter a gradient diminishing problem for the generator. The  discriminator usually wins early against the generator. It is always  easier to distinguish the generated images from real images in early  training. That makes V approaches 0. i.e. - log(1 -D(G(z))) → 0.  The gradient for the generator will also vanish which makes the  gradient descent optimization very slow. To improve that, the GAN  provides an alternative function to backpropagate the gradient to the  generator.

18," One network forms a directed acyclic
graph while another form a directed cyclic graph while connecting the nodes to
explain their temporal dynamic behavior ","18] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network. Accessed on September 12, 2019.",0.35419999999999996,"The term “recurrent neural network” is used indiscriminately to  refer to two broad classes of networks with a similar general structure,  where one is finite impulse and the other is infinite impulse. Both classes of networks exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.[7] A finite impulse recurrent network is a directed acyclic graph that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network, while an infinite impulse recurrent network is a directed cyclic graph that can not be unrolled.
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs.[1][2][3] This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition[4] or speech recognition.[5][6]
They are in fact recursive neural networks  with a particular structure: that of a linear chain. Whereas recursive  neural networks operate on any hierarchical structure, combining child  representations into parent representations, recurrent neural networks  operate on the linear progression of time, combining the previous time  step and a hidden representation into the representation for the current  time step.
Both finite impulse and infinite impulse recurrent networks can  have additional stored states, and the storage can be under direct  control by the neural network. The storage can also be replaced by  another network or graph, if that incorporates time delays or has  feedback loops. Such controlled states are referred to as gated state or  gated memory, and are part of long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units. This is also called Feedback Neural Network (FNN).
A recursive neural network[32] is created by applying the same set of weights recursively over a differentiable graph-like structure by traversing the structure in topological order. Such networks are typically also trained by the reverse mode of automatic differentiation.[33][34] They can process distributed representations of structure, such as logical terms.  A special case of recursive neural networks is the RNN whose structure  corresponds to a linear chain. Recursive neural networks have been  applied to natural language processing.[35] The Recursive Neural Tensor Network uses a tensor-based composition function for all nodes in the tree.[36]

Neural networks are  one type of model for machine learning; they have been around for at  least 50 years. The fundamental unit of a neural network is a node,  which is loosely based on the biological neuron in the mammalian brain.  The connections between neurons are also modeled on biological brains,  as is the way these connections develop over time (with “training”).
Adapting  the learning rate for your stochastic gradient descent optimization  procedure can increase performance and reduce training time. Sometimes  this is called learning rate annealing or adaptive learning rates.  The simplest and perhaps most used adaptation of learning rate during  training are techniques that reduce the learning rate over time. These  have the benefit of making large changes at the beginning of the  training procedure when larger learning rate values are used, and  decreasing the learning rate such that a smaller rate and therefore  smaller training updates are made to weights later in the training  procedure. This has the effect of quickly learning good weights early  and fine tuning them later.

In this post, I am mainly interested in the latter 3 architectures. A Convolutional Neural Network  is basically a standard neural network that has been extended across  space using shared weights. CNN is designed to recognize images by  having convolutions inside, which see the edges of an object recognized  on the image. A Recurrent Neural Network  is basically a standard neural network that has been extended across  time by having edges which feed into the next time step instead of into  the next layer in the same time step. RNN is designed to recognize  sequences, for example, a speech signal or a text. It has cycles inside  that implies the presence of short memory in the net. A Recursive Neural Network  is more like a hierarchical network where there is really no time  aspect to the input sequence but the input has to be processed  hierarchically in a tree fashion. The 10 methods below can be applied to  all of these architectures.

A deep learning framework is an interface, library or a tool which allows us to build deep learning models more easily and quickly, without getting into the details of underlying algorithms. They provide a clear and concise way for defining models using a collection of pre-built and optimized components.
The flexible architecture of TensorFlow enables us to deploy our deep learning models on one or more CPUs (as well as GPUs). Below are a few popular use cases of TensorFlow:
Automatically compute gradients
TensorFlow: Useful for rapid deployment of new algorithms/experiments
Keras is written in Python and can run on top of TensorFlow (as well as CNTK and Theano). The TensorFlow interface can be a bit challenging as it is a low-level library and new users might find it difficult to understand certain implementations.
Like I mentioned before, Deeplearning4j is a paradise for Java programmers. It offers massive support for different neural networks like CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs. It can process a huge amount of data without sacrificing speed. Sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up!
Deeplearning4j treats the task of loading data and training algorithms as separate processes. This separation of functions provides a whole lot of flexibility. And who wouldn’t like that, especially in deep learning?!
Here’s the good news – we now have easy-to-use, open source deep learning frameworks that aim to simplify the implementation of complex and large-scale deep learning models. Using these amazing frameworks, we can implement complex models like convolutional neural networks in no time.
